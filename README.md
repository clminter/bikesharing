## Summary
As noted, the weekday usage is concentrated during typical 'rush hours' and weekend usage is more evenly distributed throughout the mid-day. Mapping these concentrations of usage would be helpful in managing inventory location. The data also clearly indicates strong usage among males. It would be interesting to use this data to see if there is any correlation between Start/End Station IDs and gender usage. Another visualization that may provide insight is usage by age by gender.
